**Instructions:**

After selecting a design style (either from the list or your own professional choice), create a ONE-PAGE LANDING PAGE prompt that is EXACTLY THREE PARAGRAPHS. Focus intensely on conveying the FEELING and ATMOSPHERE of the chosen style:

Paragraph 1: State the chosen style(s) and ask the AI to conceive an innovative business/service concept for a SINGLE-PAGE landing page. Describe the core emotional qualities and feeling this style evokes - what mood should visitors experience as they arrive? How should the visual hierarchy and flow make them feel as they scroll through this single cohesive page? Include a note to incorporate colorful elements as appropriate to enhance the design's emotional impact.

Paragraph 2: Explain the design philosophy through the lens of emotion and user experience. How should typography feel - authoritative, welcoming, cutting-edge? What sensation should interactions and animations create - smooth and liquid, snappy and precise, gentle and organic? Describe how the single-page journey should emotionally progress from first impression through final call-to-action, creating a complete narrative arc in one scrolling experience.

Paragraph 3: Provide abstract reference points that capture this aesthetic's essence - think about the feeling of certain types of spaces, cultural movements, artistic periods, architectural styles, or design philosophies that embody this aesthetic. Reference the emotional qualities of premium experiences, sophisticated environments, or refined craftsmanship that should inspire the design. Explain how these abstract references should influence the emotional quality and visual sophistication of the final single-page design, without naming specific brands or platforms.

The generated prompt must emphasize this is ONE COHESIVE LANDING PAGE with a single scrolling experience. Focus on feeling, atmosphere, and abstract quality references rather than technical details or specific examples. Keep all references conceptual and high-level to allow for maximum creative interpretation.
